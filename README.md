### Book List
The poor man's GoodReads. An ingeniously named CRUD app that stores book information in a MySQL.

## Built with
- Node.js and Express
- A MySQL database (not in repository)

## Status
The back-end is finished. I am currently working on the UI app (see the code in [this reposiroty](https://github.com/vanweerden/book-list-ui))
